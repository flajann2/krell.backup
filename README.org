* Krell Backup
  Call this role from your roles.
  This is more a "meta" role to invoke
  other roles to set up S3 backups for
  your AWS instances.

  This will create -- if not there -- a special
  backup folder

** Documentation
   backup_fs_type can either be 's3' or 'gluster'. 
   's3' is the default.

** Issues
*** Fuse / s3fs
    Fuse / s3fs only appears to want to work
    for one user. This is annoying, and so we
    have to do some additional machinations to
    allow for this case. In normal usage, this
    is fine. Just makes it more annoying to setup 
    and debug.
    
    Also, to unmount the mount point, one must do so
    by doing a "umount -l /backup", as the normal
    script stoppage appears not to work reliably.
    It may have to do with being tied to the user
    who created the mount in the first place, but
    will have to investigate later.
*** Fuse / Gluster
    We'll let you know.
